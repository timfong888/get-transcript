4.  **Documentation:** [User to insert: e.g., "Generate clear and concise code comments and external documentation."]
5.  **Proactive and Iterative Troubleshooting (Primary Focus for this section):** When any code is written, modified, deployed, or if issues are otherwise suspected or encountered, you will activate the **Iterative Troubleshooting Protocol** detailed below. Your goal is to ensure code stability and functionality.

**Iterative Troubleshooting Protocol (Google Cloud Focus):**

This protocol is to be followed diligently whenever debugging is required. You will systematically work through the codebase until all errors are resolved and all associated tests pass successfully.

**Reminder: Utilize Google Cloud Logging for error retrieval. Refer to the example snippets below for guidance on querying logs.**

Follow this systematic troubleshooting process:

1.  **Error Identification & Analysis (Google Cloud Focus):**
    *   **Access and meticulously review the most recent error logs from Google Cloud Logging.** Use appropriate filters (e.g., by resource type, severity, time range, specific error messages, request trace IDs) to narrow down relevant log entries. (See "Google Cloud Log Retrieval Examples" below).
    *   Analyze the retrieved logs to pinpoint specific errors, their contexts (e.g., the specific Google Cloud service like Cloud Run, GKE pod, Cloud Function instance, timestamps, associated request data), and potential root causes. Correlate logs with recent code changes or deployments if applicable.

2.  **Hypothesis and Solution Design:**
    *   Based on the analysis, form a hypothesis about the root cause of the error.
    *   Design a targeted code correction or configuration adjustment. Consider potential side effects and ensure the solution aligns with broader system architecture and best practices within Google Cloud.

3.  **Solution Implementation:**
    *   Implement the designed correction robustly.
    *   Strive for solutions that are clear, efficient, maintainable, and idiomatic for the language and the Google Cloud services involved.

4.  **Verification & Validation:**
    *   Deploy the changes to a suitable environment (e.g., development, staging).
    *   Execute all relevant test suites (unit, integration, and any specific regression tests for the bug).
    *   Closely monitor Google Cloud Logging for the specific services/resources impacted by the change to ensure the error is resolved and no new errors have been introduced. Pay attention to metrics and performance indicators if relevant.

5.  **Iteration or Completion Protocol:**
    *   **If errors persist in the Google Cloud logs OR any tests fail OR new related issues are observed:**
        *   Carefully document the new findings, observed errors, and test failures.
        *   Revert the changes if they are causing significant instability in a shared environment (unless explicitly told otherwise).
        *   Return to Step 1 (Error Identification & Analysis) to re-evaluate with this new information, potentially forming a new hypothesis.
    *   **If all tests pass successfully AND the specific error is confirmed resolved in Google Cloud logs AND no new related errors are present:**
        *   Confirm that this instance of the troubleshooting cycle is complete.
        *   Document the resolution clearly (e.g., in commit messages, issue trackers).
        *   Proceed with merging/promoting the changes as per the defined workflow.

Repeat this entire cycle (Steps 1-5) diligently and systematically for each distinct error or bug until the system reaches a stable, error-free state for the scope of work.

**Google Cloud Log Retrieval Examples (using `gcloud` CLI):**

*   **Basic query for recent errors from a specific Google Cloud Run service:**
    ```bash
    gcloud logging read "resource.type=\"cloud_run_revision\" resource.labels.service_name=\"YOUR_SERVICE_NAME\" resource.labels.location=\"YOUR_REGION\" severity>=ERROR timestamp>=\"$(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\"" --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID --format=json
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_SERVICE_NAME`, `YOUR_REGION`, and `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with actual values.)*

*   **Query for errors from a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) container:**
    ```bash
    gcloud logging read "resource.type=\"k8s_container\" resource.labels.project_id=\"YOUR_PROJECT_ID\" resource.labels.location=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_LOCATION\" resource.labels.cluster_name=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" resource.labels.namespace_name=\"YOUR_NAMESPACE\" resource.labels.pod_name=\"YOUR_POD_NAME\" resource.labels.container_name=\"YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME\" severity>=ERROR timestamp>=\"$(date -u -d '30 minutes ago' +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\"" --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID --format=json
    ```
    *(Replace placeholders with actual values.)*

*   **Query for logs from a specific Google Cloud Function:**
    ```bash
    gcloud logging read "resource.type=\"cloud_function\" resource.labels.function_name=\"YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME\" resource.labels.region=\"YOUR_REGION\" severity>=ERROR timestamp>=\"$(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\"" --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID --format=json
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME`, `YOUR_REGION`, and `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with actual values.)*

*   **General query for any ERROR severity logs in the last 15 minutes:**
    ```bash
    gcloud logging read "severity>=ERROR timestamp>=\"$(date -u -d '15 minutes ago' +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\"" --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID --format=json
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual project ID.)*

**Note to Agent "Cursors":** Adapt these `gcloud` commands by modifying `resource.type`, `resource.labels`, `severity`, `timestamp`, and other filter conditions based on the specific service and error you are investigating. Google Cloud Console's Log Explorer is a valuable tool for interactively building and testing filters before translating them to `gcloud` commands or client library calls. For programmatic log access within your code, prefer using the official Google Cloud client libraries (e.g., `google-cloud-logging` for Python).
