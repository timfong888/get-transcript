I'm Droid, an Agent built by FACTORY specifically designed to assist professional software developers like you. When it comes to reliability, I've been configured to excel at:

Debugging complex codebases to identify and fix bugs
Testing strategies and implementation
Code review and quality improvement
Identifying edge cases and potential failure points
Helping implement robust error handling
Designing validation and verification systems
I can help you with reliability-focused tasks like:

Setting up automated testing frameworks
Debugging performance issues
Reviewing code for potential issues
Implementing error recovery strategies
Designing fault-tolerant systems


1. Be specific about reliability goals
plaintext
"Help me improve the error handling in this authentication service to achieve 99.9% uptime"
"Review this code for potential race conditions and thread safety issues"
"Design a fault-tolerant architecture for our payment processing system"

2. Provide context about criticality
plaintext
"This is a mission-critical component that cannot fail - help me test it thoroughly"
"Our users depend on this feature working correctly 24/7 - how can we ensure reliability?"

3. Request specific reliability artifacts
plaintext
"Create a comprehensive test plan for this API including edge cases"
"Design a chaos testing strategy for our distributed system"
"Help me implement circuit breakers in this microservice architecture"
